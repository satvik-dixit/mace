# MAUVE: Multimodal Audio-Text Evaluation for Automated Audio Captioning

MAUVE (Multimodal AUdio-caption EValuation) is a novel metric specifically designed for the evaluation of automated audio captioning (AAC) systems. Unlike traditional evaluation metrics that only compare machine-generated captions to human references, MAUVE leverages both audio and text to provide a comprehensive evaluation. It integrates audio content and linguistic quality, leading to more accurate assessments that align closely with human judgments.
