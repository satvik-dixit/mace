# MAUVE: Multimodal Audio-Text Evaluation for Automated Audio Captioning
[[`Paper`]()]

MAUVE (Multimodal AUdio-caption EValuation) is a metric designed for evaluating automated audio captioning (AAC) systems. Unlike metrics that compare machine-generated captions solely to human references, MAUVE uses both audio and text to improve evaluation. By integrating audio content and linguistic quality, it produces assessments that align with human judgments.
